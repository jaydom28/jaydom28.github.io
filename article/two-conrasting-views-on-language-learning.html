<p>There are some people who say that there is a critical language learning period early in life during which a person learns language extremely quickly, and anything past this point is not optimal for language learning. Sometimes this notion is brought so far to the point of saying that language learning is impossible past the critical period.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is another view in which lanuage learning aptitude is relatively constant throughout life. However, babies and young children have much more time to reflect on language and observe, which allows them to acquire language much more quickly.</p>
